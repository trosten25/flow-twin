### Do's ✅
- Use clear, descriptive folder and file names
- Include a comprehensive README.md for your project
- Add screenshots or demo links if possible
- Keep your project self-contained within your team folder
- Use `.gitignore` to exclude large files and build artifacts

### Don'ts ❌
- Don't modify other teams' folders
- Don't commit large files (>100MB) - use Git LFS if needed
- Don't include `node_modules`, `.venv`, or other dependency folders
- Don't use spaces in folder names (use hyphens or underscores)
- Don't commit sensitive information (API keys, passwords, etc.)

## 🔧 Git Best Practices

### Commit Message Format
```
Add [Team Name] - [Project Name]: Brief description

Examples:
- Add Team Alpha - Smart Waste Tracker: IoT waste management system
- Update Team Beta - AI Resume Builder: Add PDF export feature
```

### Branch Naming Convention
```
add/team-name-project-name

Examples:
- add/team-alpha-waste-tracker
- add/team-beta-resume-builder
```

### Common Issues & Solutions

- **Solution**: Make sure you're pushing to your fork, not the main repository

**Problem**: "File too large" error
